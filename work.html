						This recording (below) shows a successful transfer of a 180kB image file from one machine to another. The client machine (top-left) sends the file to the server (bottom-right). The two machines share storage so the <src>diff</src> command ran at the end (on the server) is able to compare the original file to the transferred one. The result is that the files do not differ.
					</p>
					<p>
						The file transfers from the client to the TCP daemon on the client side. The TCP daemon then passes it the the "troll" which proceeds to send the packet into the network (perhaps altering the packet). The packet is received by the server side "troll" which can further alter the packet and then send it to the TCP daemon process. This process determines whether the packet's contents are okay or not and either buffers or drops the packet. The server process receives in-order data from the TCP daemon when it requests it.

						<p>This project includes a suite of programs written in C that imitate network TCP behavior using only POSIX UDP/IP sockets. Because of the inherent lack of reliability with UDP, careful consideration and implementation went into creating this FTP application that mimicks TCP. Real network conditions are artificially created using a "troll" program which can delay, drop, garble, reorder, or duplicate single bits or entire packets (of around 1000 bytes).</p>

The client side daemon is responsible for making sure all packets are successfully received on the server side as the server sends acknowledgments back to the client. The client can also resend unacknowledged packets back with the help of a timer that calculates a retransmission timeout for each packet. Additionally, checksums are used on both ends to ensure no bits of data are affected during transfer. Further, a circular array on both sides buffers data before transmission and wraps around appropriately.</p>
